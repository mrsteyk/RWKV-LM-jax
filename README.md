# RWKV-LM in Haiku

This is a poor man's replica of [gh:BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) using JAX+Haiku.

Additional thanks to [gh:tensorpro/jax-rwkv](https://github.com/tensorpro/jax-rwkv), but it is using `flax`, with which I have a really bad experience of constant skissues.
